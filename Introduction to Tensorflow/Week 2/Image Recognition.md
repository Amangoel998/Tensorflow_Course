Machine Learning depends on having good data to train a system with. In this video you saw a scenario for training a system to recognize fashion images. The data comes from a dataset called Fashion MNIST, and you can learn more about it and explore it in GitHub here. In the next video, youâ€™ll see how to load that data and prepare it for training. You saw how the image is represented as a 28x28 array of greyscales, and how its label is a number. 

Fasion_mnist is avaiable as API call in tensorflow

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

fashion_mnist = keras.dataset.fashion_mnist
(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu),     # Can use 512 layers
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(),
    loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy'
)

```
Since in fashion_mnist, every value in dataset has value b/w 0 & 255, it is good to **Normalize** data to make values b/w 0 and 1, by diving whole array by 255.

```python
import matplitlib.pyplot as plt
pls.imshow(training_images[0])
print(training_labels[0])
print(training_images[0])

test_images, training_images = test_images/255.0, training_images/255.0

```

```python
model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5)
model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
```

Callback to end the epochs when it reaches a certain threshold after which accuracy remains constant.


```python
class LocalCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
        if(logs.get('loss')<0.4):
            print('\nLoss is low so cancelling training')
            self.model.stop_training = True

model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5, callbacks=[LocalCallback()])

```
