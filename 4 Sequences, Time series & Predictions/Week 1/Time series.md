## Time Series
- These can be seen in Stock prices, weather forecasts, historical trends(like Moore's Law), Spurious Correlations(like total revenue generated by video games arcades vs CS doctrates awarded in US).

- Time series is defined as ordered sequence of values over equally spaces time.
- In all above examples, there's regular interval of time, eg year, day, hour.
Hence, they are also called as **univariate**.

- There can be **multivariate time series** that have multiple values at each time step.
- They can be used in understanding impact of related data.

- Imputation is process to project back in past to see how we got to where we are now.
- This can also be used to fill holes in data that doesn't exist with us.

- Time series prediction can be used detect anomalies. Eg- potential DoS attacks in website logs shows spike in time series.
- TSP can be used to analyze patterns that determine what generated series itself.
Eg- Analyze sound waves to spot words in audio which can be used as neural network for speech recognition.

## Common Patterns in TS
1. Trends Pattern TS
    - Like in Moore's law, there is always a direction towards which TS is moving.

2. Seasonality Pattern TS
    - These pattern is seen when pattern repeat at predictable intervals.
    - Like shopping sites peek on weekends or sport sites peek in traffic at seasons.

1. Combination Pattern TS
    - These are combinations of both trend and seasonality.
    - Eg- Chart shows upward trend but with peaks and troughs.

2. White noise
    - These aren't predictable at all and seems to have completely random data.

3. Auto-Correlation
    - No trend, no seasonality, spikes appear at random time stamps, but complete series isn't random.
    - It correlates with delayed copy of itself, called lag.
    - Between spikes there are deterministic type of decay.
    - Memory: are the spikes which are steps dependent upon previous ones..
    - Innovations: are the spikes unpredictable based on previous values.

4. Non-Stationary Time series
    - In real-life time series behavior can changes over time.
    - Real-life events can change patterns causing disruption in seasonality and trend.
    - These are called Non-Stationary Time series.

Hence, if we train for limited number of last time steps, with better performance, we can get better accuracy in prediction.
It breaks the mold, where we always assume that more data is better.
But in time series forecasting, it really depends upon time series itself.
If TS is stationary then pattern doesn't change over time, then in that case more data is better.
But if it is not stationary, then optimal window of training will vary.

## Conclusions
1. Hour by hour temperature, is an example of a Univariate time series.
2. Hour by hour weather, is an example of a Multivariate time series.
3. Imputed data is a projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data.
4. Seasonality is a regular change in shape of the data.
5. Trend is an overall direction for data regardless of direction.
6. White Noise is unpredictable changes in time series data.
7. Auto-Correlation is data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different.
8. Non-stationary time series is one that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality.
